Bianca Andreescu;f;umiltasuna;actitud;i’d say a lot of experience you know playing on the stage in front of all of you and so i really got that experience and dealt with it way better than i expected today honestly
Casper Ruud;m;umiltasuna;actitud;I will try to get ready for uh Sunday and it will be another tough match for sure
Casper Ruud;m;umiltasuna;actitud;well it’s a little surprising honestly I didn’t think uh I was going to be in this situation
Nick Kyrgios;m;umiltasuna;actitud;playing for a lot of people back home as well so hopefully i can keep it going
Ons Jabeur;f;umiltasuna;actitud;i’m just enjoying playing tennis and uh i started in in like a very very small tennis clubs and so to be able to play here one day it’s unbelievable
Rafael Nadal;m;umiltasuna;actitud;let’s see if i am able to to play a little bit better and i hope to give myself a chance to keep going
Ajla Tomljanović;f;epaiketa teknikoak;evaluacion;the pressure wasn’t on on me so she’s serena i i didn’t think that you know i even until the last point i knew that she’s in a really good position to win even when she’s down 5-1 and i don’t know how many match points i needed to finish it off
Ajla Tomljanović;f;epaiketa teknikoak;evaluacion;the thing is that i lost that second set not by doing much wrong she just played great and i couldn’t dwell too long because i know if i’m not focused for two seconds she will run off with that third set so i just tried to hang in there and take one point at a time
Bianca Andreescu;f;epaiketa teknikoak;evaluacion;yes and no there’s definitely some moments where i’m obviously a bit more nervous than others but you have to learn how to deal with them
Bianca Andreescu;f;epaiketa teknikoak;evaluacion;i was listening to a little bit of drake and a lot of eminem he’s super motivational very inspiring and it always gets me pumped up you are super motivational and inspiring to so many of us come on make some noise so be the north bianca
Casper Ruud;m;epaiketa teknikoak;evaluacion;I think we were playing well um we were whenever someone broke one the other guy seemed to break right away back so it was tough to kind of get the lead and keep going with it because we both want to win obviously and we were sort of uh always always closed on the scoreline so honestly I don’t know but it seemed like the only time I could break him was when I was broken first so that’s not a good sign but uh in the fifth head
Iga Swiatek;f;epaiketa teknikoak;evaluacion;i’m trying to you know adjust to any possible situation uh this season and last season for sure i gained some experience in playing night sessions but um still it’s a totally different rhythm
Iga Swiatek;f;epaiketa teknikoak;evaluacion;even though the conditions aren’t you know perfect for them so i’m yeah trying to kind of find solution in in any situation
Jessica Pegula;f;epaiketa teknikoak;evaluacion;I just maybe got a little tentative in the tie break so I felt like I was playing like better so the third set I just wanted to get out to an early lead and try to stay focused
Nick Kyrgios;m;epaiketa teknikoak;evaluacion;i knew i had to be on my guns today serve well
Novak Djokovic;m;epaiketa teknikoak;evaluacion;all the sets were quite close a few points decided really a winner today
Novak Djokovic;m;epaiketa teknikoak;evaluacion;i don’t think i started off very well i was quite passive i was too far back in the court
Ons Jabeur;f;epaiketa teknikoak;evaluacion;i was playing good you know it’s not like i was playing bad that i had to get my rhythm so uh for me i was waiting for uh for that moment
Ons Jabeur;f;epaiketa teknikoak;evaluacion;the trick with a drop shot is to always uh make it the opposite side of the player running
Rafael Nadal;m;epaiketa teknikoak;evaluacion;i increased a little bit the level today i think uh so that’s important for me no when when the tournament is uh is keep going i am able to to rise a little bit to raise a little bit the level
Casper Ruud;m;positibotasuna;actitud;I’m of course enjoying the moment and it’s a nice situation to be and uh I don’t feel any pressure I I used it as motivation
Casper Ruud;m;positibotasuna;actitud;I know there are many tough matches and many more sets that needs to be played in one but uh it’s nice to meet the situation
Iga Swiatek;f;positibotasuna;actitud;well you know i’m just trying to enjoy um any match even even when i’m not playing perfectly i’m trying to just you know go
Nick Kyrgios;m;positibotasuna;actitud;i’m really excited to play medev
Ons Jabeur;f;positibotasuna;actitud;i’m just enjoying playing tennis and uh i started in in like a very very small tennis clubs and so to be able to play here one day it’s unbelievable
Rafael Nadal;m;positibotasuna;actitud;let’s see if i am able to to play a little bit better and i hope to give myself a chance to keep going
Ajla Tomljanović;f;arerioari errespetua;relaciones;i love sereno just as much as you guys do and what she’s done for me for the sport of tennis is incredible and i never thought that i’d have a chance to play her in in her last match when i remember watching her as a kid in all those finals so this is a surreal moment for me

Jessica Pegula;f;arerioari errespetua;relaciones;she was swinging pretty free today
