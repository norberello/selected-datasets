4612207;Ajla Tomljanović;f;rival;relaciones sociales;i love sereno just as much as you guys do and what she’s done for me for the sport of tennis is incredible and i never thought that i’d have a chance to play her in in her last match when i remember watching her as a kid in all those finals so this is a surreal moment for me
4612220;Ajla Tomljanović;f;esfuerzo;autopercepcion;you can do anything if you believe in yourself you love what you do and you have an incredible support system and family around you
4612221;Ajla Tomljanović;f;rival;relaciones sociales;i will definitely miss seeing her on the courts it will not be the same
4612227;Ajla Tomljanović;f;rival;relaciones sociales;that’s just who she is and she’s the greatest of all time period she threw everything at you even down 5-1
4612231;Ajla Tomljanović;f;rival;relaciones sociales;i think she’s embodies that no dream is too big and doesn’t matter where you come from
4806829;Ajla Tomljanović;f;juicios técnicos;evaluacion técnica;the pressure wasn’t on on me so she’s serena i i didn’t think that you know i even until the last point i knew that she’s in a really good position to win even when she’s down 5-1 and i don’t know how many match points i needed to finish it off
4806834;Ajla Tomljanović;f;juicios técnicos;evaluacion técnica;the thing is that i lost that second set not by doing much wrong she just played great and i couldn’t dwell too long because i know if i’m not focused for two seconds she will run off with that third set so i just tried to hang in there and take one point at a time
4806836;Ajla Tomljanović;f;rival;relaciones sociales;we know how special serena is to you can you describe what she means to everybody else
4806840;Ajla Tomljanović;f;agradecimientos;relaciones sociales;you know i travel with my family as well and she’s always been someone i looked up

4806850;Bianca Andreescu;f;juicios técnicos;evaluacion técnica;yes and no there’s definitely some moments where i’m obviously a bit more nervous than others but you have to learn how to deal with them
4806853;Bianca Andreescu;f;humildad;autopercepcion;i’d say a lot of experience you know playing on the stage in front of all of you and so i really got that experience and dealt with it way better than i expected today honestly

4612275;Casper Ruud;m;esfuerzo;autopercepcion;I played some of my best tennis this year and the best tennis I played this tournament and very happy that uh everything went my way in the fifth set
4612278;Casper Ruud;m;esfuerzo;autopercepcion;it’s not every day that you surpass four hours on court playing the match so but that’s what we trained for
4806875;Casper Ruud;m;juicios técnicos;evaluacion técnica;I think we were playing well um we were whenever someone broke one the other guy seemed to break right away back so it was tough to kind of get the lead and keep going with it because we both want to win obviously and we were sort of uh always always closed on the scoreline so honestly I don’t know but it seemed like the only time I could break him was when I was broken first so that’s not a good sign but uh in the fifth head
4806879;Casper Ruud;m;humildad;autopercepcion;I will try to get ready for uh Sunday and it will be another tough match for sure
4806885;Casper Ruud;m;humildad;autopercepcion;well it’s a little surprising honestly I didn’t think uh I was going to be in this situation
